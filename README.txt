This collection of files is a Python code implementation of the three-dimensional simplified Janbu calculation theory in the limit equilibrium method, and each folder can be run independently and complete each step. If you only need to get the stability coefficient calculation and the final visualization from the final traversal calculation, you can first run the code contained in the F folder to get the output data table. Then run the code contained in the G folder to import the output of the table in F. Run to get a visual drawing. Most of each folder has some case output pictures for testing reference.
